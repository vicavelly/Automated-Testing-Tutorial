            Automated testing is the practice of writing codes to test our code, and then run those test
            in an automated fashion

            With automated testing, our cods/program will consist of production codes and test codes

            BENEFITS OF AUTOMATED TESTING
            -----------------------------
            1.  Ability to test your application code frequently and in less time.\
            2.  The main advantage is the ability to catch bugs in the application before deployment. 
                NOTE: This doesn't mean our programs would be completely bug free, but this can certainly reduce the num
                        of bugs and improve the quality of our software.

            3.  Refactoring with confidence.  Without automated testing, Whenever we refactor our code, we have to manually 
                                              test every part of the application that could be affected by our refactoring

            4.  It helps us focus more on the quality of code / quality of methods that we're writing.
